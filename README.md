# Rootbars

## What Rootbars are

Rootbars are svg's that come in come exact file sizes 
* 1kB
* 2kB
* 4kB
* 8kB
* 16kB

Rootbars represent the value of blockspace on the rootstock chain.

## Smart Contract

## Development

Rootbars were developed during Eth Global Brussels 2024. We deployed one collection with no permissions, where anybody can mint rootBars

We deployed a special collection called Rootbars: Eth Global Brussels 2024 edition. This collection can be minted during the hackathon, but not after. 

## Ordinals

The orginals protocol has a feature that lets you teleburn EVM assets onto ordinals inscriptions. 

So as an extra bonus, we minted a new collection of inscriptions on Bitcoin, called BitRootBars, in 1KB sizes.

To create your BitRootBar, first you must acquire a new BitRootBar, then you must send a 1 KB RootBar to the teleburn address. 
Then each BitRootBar represents the value of 1 KB of blockspace on Bitcoin, AND 1 KB of blockspace on roostock Mainnet! 

This is a combination Bitcoin and Rootstock Mainnet NFT.

## Inspiration

The Rootbar design is based on bitbars (a Bitcoin NFT) https://bitbars.xyz 

They look like gold bars to convey a sense of value, and to show that blockspace (even used blockspace) is a valuable commodity. 

## Future editions

For future editions of rootBars, we will
* figure out how if we can store larger svgs (32kB, 64kB) etc
* how reduce gas costs per kB as much as possible
* make it easy for people to store valuable public data of their choice inside rootBars.
* Valuable public data provides more value than repetitive dummy data that is currently inside the rootBars

## Concerns

**Isnt this a spam attack?** 
- One man's spam is another mans treasure. Besides aren't blockchains supposed to be permissionless? we can do what we want. 

**Why not use offchain storage to save costs**
- The entire point of minting these NFTs is to spend gas to acquire tradable, transferrable blockspace, which we see as a valuable commidity. 
Therefore gas efficiency is not a primary concern
